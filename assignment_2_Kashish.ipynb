    "Obtained from DATASETS (muratkoklu.com) and used in M. Koklu, R. Kursun, Y.S. Taspinar, and I. Cinar, \"Classification of Date Fruits into Genetic Varieties Using Image Analysis,\" Mathematical Problems in Engineering, Vol.2021, Article ID: 4793293 (2021).\n",

    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "In food production it is important to properly label ingredients for both health and business reasons. However, sometimes mistakes are made and there is room for improvement in food labeling practices. A number of different types of dates are grown around the world, and it takes expertise to correctly identify the variety. Your job as a machine learning developer is to create a model that can identify the type of date from external features such as colour, length, diameter and shape factors which have been determined by a computer vision model.\n",

    "When examining the validation accuracies across all experiments, it was observed that the best-performing model was the one that increased both the number of layers and the number of units per layer. This increase in model capacity allowed the network to better capture complex patterns in the data, leading to improved generalization on the validation set. Increasing the number of training epochs can also improve performance, as the model has more opportunities to minimize the loss function. However, this approach is more prone to overfitting, especially once the model begins to memorize the training data rather than learn meaningful patterns. Additionally, training for more epochs significantly increases computational time, making it less efficient for identifying the optimal model configuration compared to architectural improvements."
