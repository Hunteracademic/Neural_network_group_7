    "Problem Statement:\n",
    "In food production it is important to properly label ingredients for both health and business reasons. However, sometimes mistakes are made and there is room for improvement in food labeling practices. A number of different types of dates are grown around the world, and it takes expertise to correctly identify the variety. Your job as a machine learning developer is to create a model that can identify the type of date from external features such as colour, length, diameter and shape factors which have been determined by a computer vision model.\n",
